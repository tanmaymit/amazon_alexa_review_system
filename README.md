# amazon_alexa_review_system

Introduction
This project analyzes customer reviews of Amazon Alexa using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict feedback sentiment (positive/negative). We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to preprocess text data and train a Random Forest Classifier to classify customer reviews.

Dataset

The dataset, amazon_alexa.tsv, contains the following columns:
rating: Customer rating (1 to 5)
verified_reviews: Review text
feedback: 1 (positive) or 0 (negative)
variation: Different Alexa models
date: Review date (removed during preprocessing)
